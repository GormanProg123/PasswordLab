## Description

Password Lab is a web-based project for generating and verifying the security and strength of passwords.  
Built with **React + TypeScript + Vite + Charts**, the app evaluates password strength using **zxcvbn** (a password strength estimator), custom internal rules (like minimum length), and even simulates **dictionary attacks**.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- **Password Strength Analysis** using:
  - `zxcvbn`
  - Entropy
  - Time to Crack
  - log10(guesses)
  - Estimated Hacking Time
  - Internal Recommendations (e.g., too short, missing symbols, etc.)
- **Password Generator** with customizable options:
  - Password length
  - Include numbers
  - Include symbols
  - Include uppercase letters
- **Dictionary Attack Simulation**:
  - Enter a password and check if it matches common words
